///
/// This package implements a library built on Open Scene Graph to display
/// various geometric primitives.
///
/// The library is able to parse urdf files and to create objects with
/// each link of the robot.
///
/// Basic geometric primitives can also be built (boxes, cylinders,
/// capsules,...)
///
/// Also in OpenSceneGraph, objects are organized in trees, there is no
/// kinematic chain in the strict sense of robotics. Each object can be placed
/// separately in the world frame.
